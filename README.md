My favorite movie is ***Rurouni Kenshin Origins***.
The protagonist in this movie is **Kenshin Himura**, known as the **Battosai**, a deadly assassin whose fierce swordsmanship has killed over one hundred men in one year. He made a vow to never kill again. That is when he became a wandering samurai that offers aid and protection to those in need as an atonement for his past deeds. However, his commitment to never take lives again is put into test as he helps those people that are threatened by the figures from his past.

The main cast in this movie are:
1. **Takeru Satoh** as **Kenshin Himura**
2. **YÃ» Aoi** as **Megumi Takani**
3. **Kazuki Kitamura** as **Saito Hajime**
4. **Munetaka Aoki** as **Sanosuke Sagara**
5. **Emi Takei** as **Kaoru Kamiya**

This movie is the very first Rurouni Kenshin live action movie released and recommended to watch it before watching ***Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno***.

Here is the chronological order of release dates of **Rurouni Kenshin Live Action Movies**:
> 1. *Rurouni Kenshin Origins (2012)*
